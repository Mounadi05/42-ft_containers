# ft_containers - 42 Project
 

This repository contains my implementation of various container classes in C++ as part of the ft_containers project at 42. The goal of this project is to re-implement some of the fundamental container classes provided by the C++  98 Standard Library.

 
## Introduction
The C++ Standard Library provides a rich set of container classes that are widely used in software development. This project aims to replicate the behavior and functionality of some of these container classes such as vector, map, stack. By implementing these containers from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of their underlying principles and how they are implemented in practice.

## Implemented Containers
The following container classes have been implemented in this project:

* Vector
* Map
* Stack

- Each container class has been implemented with the appropriate member functions and iterators, closely resembling the interfaces and behaviors of the corresponding classes from the C++ 98 Standard Library.

## Usage
To use these containers in your project, you can clone this repository and include the necessary files in your project's source code. Here's how you can get started:

- Clone the repository:
  - git clone github.com/Mounadi05/42-ft_containers

### Include the desired container header file in your source code:
```cpp
#include "ft_vector.hpp"  // for Vector
#include "ft_map.hpp"     // for Map
#include "ft_stack.hpp"   // for Stack
```
